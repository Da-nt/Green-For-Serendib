                        Deforestation is not the easiest thing to conquer, with the ever growing population, reource production has to keep up to keep the needs of the human race satified. Hence, we can't just stop deforestation. So what can we do to minimise or revert the damages caused by deforestation? Here are a couple of things YOU can do stating TODAY to start making this world a greener environmental friendly country.

                    <img src="images/plant-a-tree.jpg" alt="Plant a Tree" width= "320" height= "330">   
                    <p>The most straightforward way of fighting deforestation is by planting a tree. An act as simple as planting a tree can have many positive side effects. By planting trees you help fight global warming because trees absorb carbon disoxide. Trees can also prevent landslides and even soothe the mind of the caretaker and improve their mental well-being</p>

                    <div class="method-box">
                        
                    <img src="images/certified-wood.jpg" alt="Certified Wood Products" width= "320" height= "330">     
                    <p>By buying certified wood products you can help reduce the demand for logging by ensuring that you only purchase products which are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. The FSC is the best global standard in forest management, and provides a system to work towards responsible forest management.</p>

                    <p>Using recycled product helps reduce the demand for more timber. Nowadays, books, paper bags, egg packaging and even toilet paper can be made with recycling paper. Buy these sustainable product to make a concious effort towards reducing deforestation. You can also recycle your own used paper to further help reduce the need for timber.</p>

                    <p>Use less paper. Globally, 40 percent of all timber is used to make paper products, and the demand for paper increases by two to three percent every year. This means that the paper industry is still consuming more and more trees. In the current era of digitization try to reduce the amount of papers you use whenever you can.</p>

                    <p>In today's world people care about sustainability more than ever. With our planet slowly dying around us ,many people have started doing their part in protecting the earth. Even though the topic of sustainabilty is very popular, there are still those who don't know about it. Raise awareness by educating the people around you to lead a more sustainable life.</p>

                    <p>Illegal logging is very common in today's world. Since timber is a very high in demand resource it's not suprising that people tend to gather and collect timber in secret. As human being who inhabit this world we have a duty to inform the relevant authorities about any signs of illegal logging to protect our forests and reduce the needed deaths of trees.</p>
