                        <h2>What Is Deforestation?</h2>
                        
                         <p>Deforestation is the purposeful clearing of forested land. When people deforest the land, the land gets deforested. This is what deforestation means.</p>

                        <h2>Why and How Does Deforestation Happen?</h2>
                        
                         <p>Deforestation may be increadibly harmful to the planet but it is a necessary action that needs to be taken in order to accomodate and provide for the fast growing human population.<br><br>
                         Deforestation occurs when forest land is cleared to either take its recources for consumption, or when forest land is cleared to make way more industrial expansions. Logging, mining, urbanization, overpopulation, agricultural expansion, forest fires and cattle ranching are a few causes of deforestation.

                                <h3>Logging</h3>
                                Logging is known as the commercial felling of trees and it it believed to be the 2nd largest cause for deforestation. More than 250 million trees are cut down for food everyday. This means that every 2.5 seconds, one tree is cut down. Since the demand for timber is extremely high all the time logging is an act that shows no sign of decreasing anytime soon.</article>

                                <h3>Cattle Ranching</h3>
                                Cattle ranching is one of the biggest reaons for deforestation. As the demand for beef increases, the space to keep these animals must also become bigger. It is said that the leading cause of deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest in Brazil is cattle ranching.</article>

                                <h3>Agricultural Expansion</h3>
                                Accounting for more than 70% of the deforestation rates in the entire world, agricultural expansion is the biggest cause of deforestation in the world. As the human population increases the need to grow more crops and food also rises. For this, large amounts of forests are cleared out to make large scales farms and plantation. Though having more agriculture is good for the planet, the amount of forests being cleared out for it does a far greater damage.

                        <h2>Why Exactly Is Deforestation Bad?</h2>
                        
                         <p>The more forests are cut down the more trees get reduced. Trees absorb carbon dioxide so if they get reduced carbon dioxide and other harmful greenhouse gases are remain in the atmosphere. It is said that deforestation is one of the main reasons for global warming to occur. If we cannot stop deforestation we cannot fight climate crisis. And if we cannot stop climate crisis, this planet will inevitably be nothing but a wasteland unsuitable for life. </p>
