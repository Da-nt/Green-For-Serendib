All nicknames given to Sri Lanka to try and encapture the wondrous nature of this island. Sri Lanka is home to many different biodiversities and climates. Blessed to have many natural resources and scenic locations, Sri Lanka is a very popular tourist destination to plan a getaway.

                         <p>
                             in the 1920s, Sri Lanka 49% of the entire island was covered by rainforests and other natural landfills. In 2018 that number had been reduced to 28%. That means in less than a 100 years Sri Lanka's forest has fallen over 20%. Between 1920 and 2000 the country has lost forest cover of over 26,800 ha per year.
